# Licensing Guide

## Current License

This repository is licensed under AGPLv3, except where noted in this document.

## External Contributions

External contributions are not yet accepted. Edera might utilize a different license or continue using AGPLv3, but with an associated (intentionally contributor friendly) CLA in order to allow external contribution.

The current external contribution situation is due to the upstart of Edera and the desire to create a licensing model that respects the
our contributors while also ensuring that Edera can be a sustainable business. Edera is committed to open-source and giving back to the community, and care is being taken to ensure it is positioned for those goals.
